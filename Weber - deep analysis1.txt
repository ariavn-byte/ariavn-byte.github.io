First attempt 
 
pages 3-4: Foundational Concepts
Key Distinctions
*	Weber vs. Arendt on Power: Max Weber defines power as the ability to impose one's 
will on others, emphasizing force and coercion. In contrast, Hannah Arendt views power 
as emerging from collective agreement through communication, highlighting a non-
coercive, consensus-driven model.
*	Teleological vs. Communicative Models: Weber's teleological model focuses on goal-
oriented action driven by individual success, while Arendt's communicative model 
emphasizes collective action and agreement as ends in themselves.
Important Concepts
*	Force (Gewalt) vs. Power: Arendt distinguishes between "force," associated with 
coercion, and "power," which is about collective will formation through communication.
*	Consensus and Rationality: The idea that true power arises from consensus achieved 
through rational discourse, not manipulation or coercion.
Pages 5-7: Systems Theory and Power
Theoretical Framework
*	Parsons' Systems Theory: Talcott Parsons' view integrates power as a systemic property 
that mobilizes resources for collective goals, blending aspects of both Weber's and 
Arendt's theories.
*	Illocutionary vs. Perlocutionary Acts: Differentiating between speech acts aimed at 
establishing mutual understanding (illocutionary) versus those intended to influence 
behavior (perlocutionary).
Critical Analysis
*	Power as an End in Itself: Arendt's notion that power serves to maintain the praxis from 
which it originates, manifesting in political institutions that embody collective 
agreement.
Pages 8-10: Anthropological Foundations
Structural Elements
*	Renewal of Praxis in "The Human Condition": Arendt's work renews the Aristotelian 
concept of praxis, focusing on communicative action as foundational for cultural life.
*	Space of Appearance and Human Plurality: The idea that political life emerges in spaces 
where individuals appear and interact, emphasizing plurality and natality (the potential 
for new beginnings).
Intersubjective Dimensions
*	Life-World Formation: The creation of a shared social reality through communication, 
where individuals reveal themselves and recognize each other as equals capable of 
agreement.
Pages 11-13: Political Applications
Historical Analysis
*	Totalitarianism vs. Revolutionary Liberty: Arendt contrasts the destruction of political 
liberty under totalitarian regimes with the establishment of liberty through 
revolutionary movements.
*	Mass Democracy Critique: Criticism of modern democracies for reducing political 
engagement to administrative processes, thereby undermining true political action.
Institutional Aspects
*	Role of Political Institutions: Institutions are seen as embodiments of power that require 
continuous public support to remain effective and legitimate.
Pages 14-15: Theoretical Limitations
Conceptual Problems
*	Public vs. Private Sphere Dichotomy: Arendt's rigid separation between public and 
private spheres limits her theory's applicability to modern contexts where these realms 
are intertwined.
*	State-Economy Relationship: The challenge of integrating socio-economic issues into 
political discourse without diluting the essence of political action.
Modern Challenges
*	Administrative Politics: The transformation of politics into administration is seen as a 
threat to genuine political engagement and liberty.
*	Limits of Classical Political Theory: Arendt's adherence to classical distinctions is 
critiqued for being inadequate in addressing contemporary socio-political complexities.
This page-by-page breakdown highlights the critical elements within Habermas's analysis of 
Arendt s concept of power, providing a foundation for deeper exploration into how these ideas 
interact with broader socio-political theories.

Second Attempt 
 
 
 
Page 1:
Habermas begins by introducing the topic of Hannah Arendt's concept of power. He notes that it 
contrasts with Max Weber's more traditional definition. This sets the stage for a detailed comparison 
and analysis of the two perspectives. [cite: 1, 2]
Page 2:
Habermas explicitly contrasts Arendt's and Weber's definitions of power. He introduces the concept of 
the "teleological model of action," which underpins Weber's definition. This model emphasizes 
individual goal-oriented action and the use of power as a means to achieve those goals. [cite: 5, 6, 7, 8, 
9, 10]
Page 3:
The concept of "free agreement" is introduced as a key distinction between Arendt's and Weber's views. 
Habermas argues that the teleological model doesn't genuinely allow for free agreement, as any 
consensus reached is merely a means to an end for each individual actor. [cite: 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]
Page 4:
Habermas introduces Arendt's alternative model, the "communicative model of action." This model 
emphasizes the formation of a common will through unconstrained communication. He contrasts this 
with Parsons' systems-theoretic concept of power, which, like Weber's, focuses on achieving collective 
goals rather than genuine consensus. [cite: 19, 20, 21, 30, 31, 32]
Page 5:
The idea of "reaching agreement as an end in itself" is further developed. Habermas highlights the 
importance of the "rationality claim immanent in speech," arguing that true consensus arises from a 
shared commitment to rational discourse and mutual understanding. [cite: 39, 40, 43, 44, 45]
Page 6:
Habermas explores the implications of Arendt's concept of power, noting that it is an end in itself, 
serving to maintain the communicative praxis from which it originates. He also points out the normative 
dimension of Arendt's concept, raising the question of its scientific utility. [cite: 50, 51, 56, 57]
Page 7:
Habermas delves into the theoretical foundations of Arendt's concept, linking it to her renewal of the 
Aristotelian concept of "praxis." He introduces the concept of the "life-world" as the shared space of 
communicative action, shaped by human plurality and natality. [cite: 62, 63, 64, 65, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 
73]
Page 8:
The concept of "unimpaired intersubjectivity" is introduced as a central component of Arendt's theory. 
Habermas explains how these structures, formed through communicative action, are essential for a 
"normal" and "worthy" human existence. [cite: 78, 79, 80, 81, 85, 86, 87]
Page 9:
Habermas highlights Arendt's central hypothesis: political legitimacy and power are inextricably linked 
to the preservation of undistorted communication within the public realm. Replacing power with force 
leads to the decline of political communities. [cite: 90, 91, 92, 93]
Page 10:
Habermas explores Arendt's analysis of totalitarian rule, emphasizing the destruction of communicative 
structures and the isolation of individuals. He points out the unique characteristic of totalitarian regimes 
to mobilize depoliticized masses, making them complicit in the regime's actions. [cite: 96, 97, 98, 99, 
105]
Page 11:
Habermas discusses Arendt's critique of privatism in modern societies, arguing that the privatistic 
lifestyle, coupled with the bureaucratic structures of modern states, creates fertile ground for the rise of 
totalitarian rule. [cite: 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120]
Page 12:
The dangers of privatism are further explored in the context of democratic elitism. Habermas highlights 
Arendt's concern that the bureaucratization of political participation in modern democracies can lead to 
the mobilization of the unpolitical masses. [cite: 125, 126, 127]
Page 13:
Habermas shifts the focus to Arendt's analysis of revolutionary movements and the establishment of 
political liberty. He emphasizes the power of common conviction and its ability to challenge illegitimate 
institutions and coercive state apparatuses. [cite: 130, 131, 132]
Page 14:
Habermas examines Arendt's observations on the historical attempts to institutionalize direct 
democracy. He notes the recurring motif of the "pathos of the new beginning" and the desire to give 
institutional permanence to the communicative generation of power. [cite: 143, 144, 145, 146, 147]
Page 15:
Habermas begins his critique of Arendt's theory, focusing on her rigid dichotomies between the public 
and private spheres, and between the state and the economy. He argues that these dichotomies, 
derived from her idealized image of the Greek polis, are not applicable to modern societies. [cite: 152, 
153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158]
Page 16:
Habermas criticizes Arendt's view that the intrusion of social and economic matters into the political 
realm is inherently destructive. He argues that her narrow conception of politics, focused solely on the 
"practical," blinds her to the complex interplay between the political, social, and economic spheres in 
modern societies. [cite: 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172]
Page 17:
Habermas challenges Arendt's exclusion of strategic elements from the realm of politics. He argues that 
strategic action, while distinct from communicative action, is still a form of social interaction and plays a 
crucial role in the acquisition and maintenance of political power. [cite: 177, 178, 179]
Page 18:
The distinction between political power and force is further explored in the context of warfare. 
Habermas argues that while warfare highlights the contrast between power and force, it should not lead 
to the complete exclusion of strategic action from the political sphere. [cite: 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 
188, 189, 190, 191]
Page 19:
Habermas emphasizes the growing importance of strategic action in modern societies, particularly with 
the rise of capitalism and the institutionalization of strategic competition within the political system. 
[cite: 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203]
Page 20:
The discussion of strategic action continues with an analysis of its institutionalization in the modern 
state. Habermas argues that the competition for political power, while necessary, should not be 
mistaken for the generation of legitimate power, which arises from unconstrained communication. [cite: 
208, 209, 210]
Page 21:
Habermas shifts the focus to the employment of legitimate power, emphasizing the role of binding 
decisions made by those in positions of authority. He points out the limitations of Arendt's action-
theoretic framework in analyzing the employment of power within a political system. [cite: 213, 214, 
215, 216, 217]
Page 22:
Habermas critiques Parsons' systems theory approach to power generation, arguing that it fails to 
capture the communicative dimension of power emphasized by Arendt. He highlights the importance of 
unconstrained communication in the production of power, which cannot be simply generated "from 
above." [cite: 237, 238, 239, 240, 241]
Page 23:
Habermas introduces the concept of structural violence, suggesting that it can explain the persistence of 
political rule even in the absence of widespread consensus. He argues that structural violence can block 
communications and lead to the formation of illusionary convictions, which can be used to legitimize 
power. [cite: 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268]
Page 24:
The distinction between illusionary and non-illusionary convictions is explored. Habermas criticizes 
Arendt's sharp distinction between knowledge and opinion, arguing that it prevents her from 
recognizing the rational discourse as a basis for legitimate power. [cite: 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 
275, 276]
Page 25:
Habermas concludes by discussing Arendt's reliance on the concept of contract and mutual obligation as 
the foundation of power. He suggests that Arendt's retreat to contract theory reflects her reluctance to 
fully embrace the implications of her own concept of communicative praxis. [cite: 277, 278, 279, 280]
